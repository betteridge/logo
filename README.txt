Use .eps files for print. These are the master files containing vector images of the logo, which may be scaled to any size. The lettering can also be changed to any color.

The following raster formats are derived from the black .eps versions the logo and are provided as a convenience when Illustrator is not available:

.jpg and .png versions are smaller files, used for previews (710px x 118px, 72dpi). .jpg images have a white background; .png images have a transparent background.

.tiff versions are larger (1913px x 305px, 300dpi) and may be scaled down and converted to other formats for web or general use. Unlike .jpg or .png files, .tiff files don't degrade in image quality each time you re-save.

300dpi is for print. 72dpi is for web.
